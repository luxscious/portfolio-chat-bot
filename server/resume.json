    "summary": "I’m a software engineer and cybersecurity researcher based in Canada. I recently finished my Master’s in Software Engineering at Western University, where I led research on securing electric vehicle charging infrastructure using open-source tools like EVerest and MQTT. I focused on network vulnerabilities, simulated attacks, and built ML-based intrusion detection systems. People describe me as bubbly and energetic — I genuinely love tackling new problems and never back down from a challenge. I’ve worked at startups, mentored students as a TA, and led full-stack projects across front-end, back-end, and cloud. Outside of code, I’m deeply into competitive gaming. I’ve played on two varsity esports teams at Western and love Riot Games for how it pushes me both strategically and personally. I bring that same mindset to my work: thoughtful, driven, and always excited to level up.",
